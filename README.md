# branch-name

> Get the current branch name.

## Why?

 - Clean, minimal, promise-based API.
 - Respects your `$PATH`.
 - Uses the most reliable branch [detection algorithm](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19585361/2990144).
 - Gives you control in weird situations.

## Install

```sh
npm install branch-name --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const branchName = require('branch-name');
```

Get the current branch name.

```js
branchName.get().then((name) => {
   console.log(name);
});
```

Get the current branch name, but with a fallback result for detached head and non-repository situations.

```js
branchName.assume('dev').then((name) => {
   console.log(name);  // prints current branch if possible, 'dev' otherwise
});
```

Get the current branch name, with the default `master` as a fallback.

```js
branchName.assumeMaster().then((name) => {
   console.log(name);  // prints current branch if possible, 'master' otherwise
});
```
